# Data Science for Economic Development

For my senior thesis, I plan to explore how we can apply big data and machine learning techniques to the field of development economics. Using data to better understand existing economic problems can help contribute to plans to solve these problems, and I want to try applying data science techniques to large economic datasets to see if these techniques produce significant and accurate results. This repository will be updated throughout the year as I conduct my research.
